                        Throughout human history, we've assumed that growing old and losing our health was
                        inevitable. In recent years, scientists have begun to challenge this assumption and ask whether
                        there are things people can do to slow down and even reverse their aging processes. This gave
                        rise to the idea of biological age. Chronological age is how long ago you were born. Biological
                        age is how old your body is from a functional perspective. Chronological age and biological can
                        often be different. We've all seen people who are older in years, yet they seem much younger
                        and more vital than they actually are.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead text-center">
                        Before I got married, I went to China with my then fiancée, Yihong, to ask her mom's
                        permission to marry Yihong. Yihong's mom was almost 80 at the time and I expected that I
                        would be spending my time sitting on a couch and drinking tea with her. Instead, Yihong's
                        mom took me to the local park and taught me Chinese sword fighting. There I was, practicing
                        Chinese sword fighting with an almost 80-year-old woman. Clearly, her biological age was much
                        younger than her chronological age. On the other hand, we've also seen the opposite. People
                        who are chronologically young but seem tired, run-down and even prone to illness. Those
                        people are aging faster than normal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead text-center">
                        For years, I've been trying to do as much as I can to maintain my health and slow my own aging
                        process. I do intermittent fasting, eat healthy foods, exercise, take nutritional supplements, get
                        good quality sleep, manage my stress and even take saunas a few times a week. The results
                        have been amazing for me. I'm at retirement age, but I still work 7 days a week. I cannot
                        remember the last time I took a sick day from work, although I know it was more than 20 years
                        ago. My doctor visits consist of annual checkups, blood tests, and vaccinations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead text-center">
                        I wanted to see if the things I do to help slow down my aging process and build my health could
                        work for others. I initiated a research project with middle-aged adults. We started by taking
                        DNA samples and sending them to a lab to measure the participants' biological ages. Then, we
                        put them on a four-month program of diet, exercise, nutritional supplements, stress
                        management and healthy sleep habits. At the end of the four months, we took DNA samples
                        again and sent them to the lab to see what happened to our participants' biological ages.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead text-center">
                        Logically, one might expect that since four months had passed, each person would be
                        biologically four months older. Instead, we found that every person, 100% of the participants,
                        were now biologically younger than when they started the program. The range was 5-12 years.
                        In other words, after just four months, each person grew biologically younger by at least 5 years
                        and as much as 12 years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead text-center">
                        I wanted to bring that type of result to the world. Imagine the humanitarian benefits if people
                        could live longer and be healthier in doing so. They could spend more time with their families
                        and loved ones. They would have more time and better health to do the things they love to do.
                        They would be more productive in society. Our country spends trillions of dollars on healthcare
                        each year. Imagine if we could cut that greatly because people are healthy. We would have
                        more resources to spend on things like education, scientific research, job training, improving
                        the environment and solving societal problems like hunger and homelessness.

                        This humanitarian goal gave rise to the My Youthpan software we are creating, expected to hit
                        the market in early 2024. We want to take the latest research in health and longevity and use
                        machine learning and data science to make personalized recommendations to people on what
                        they can do to live longer and be healthier.
